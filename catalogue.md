# Index of stylistic "tics" and "tells"

Models purported to be "good at creative writing," such as DeepSeek R1 and an unreleased OpenAI model, display a remarkably narrow and consistent literary style typefied by the features catalogued here.

It is striking that the OpenAI model – judging from the one example we have – shows _the same_ distinctive stylistic quirks as DeepSeek R1.  I don't know what to make of this.

I noted multiple instances of these "tics" in every model-generated text included here, except for [the Hemingway pastiche](./stories/nost-pastiche-hemingway.md), which had none of them at all – presumably because Hemingway himself has a distinctive and constrained style which leaves no room for these kinds of flourishes.
