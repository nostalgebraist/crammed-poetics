**Title: "Ashtrays and Afterthoughts"**

The kitchen light buzzed, a flicker in its pulse. Marjorie stood by the sink, her robe cinched tight, staring at the ashtray overflowing with butts. One, lipstick-stained—coral, not her shade. She picked it up, rolled it between thumb and finger.

Frank shuffled in, socks whispering on linoleum. He filled the percolator, spooned grounds with exaggerated care. The clock ticked.

"Party got lively after I left bed," she said. 

He grunted, back turned. Steam rose, hissing.

She set the cigarette butt on the counter. "Yvonne wears this color. From the office."

Frank poured coffee, black, into two chipped mugs. "Could be anyone's." His hand trembled, liquid pooling in the saucer.

Marjorie studied the linoleum crack they’d meant to fix since ’78. Rain smeared the window above the table. She remembered the way he’d laughed last night, a sound like gravel in a tin can, sharp and unfamiliar.

They sat. He stirred sugar he didn’t take, clinking the spoon too long. 

Outside, a garbage truck groaned. 

She thought of the honeymoon motel in Astoria, salt air rusting the bedframe. How he’d saved her from the riptide, hands raw and sure. Now his nails were yellowed, cuticles chewed raw.

Frank cleared his throat. "Gonna check the Pontiac’s carburetor." 

The screen door slapped. 

Marjorie traced the coral stain, pressed it to her lips. A ghost of someone else’s mouth. In the yard, Frank knelt by the car, rags and rage in his fists. She watched the rain erase him, sip by sip.
