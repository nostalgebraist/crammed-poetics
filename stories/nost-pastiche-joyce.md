**Title: "The Weight of Shadows"**

Evening draped itself over Dublin like a damp cloak, the Liffey exhaling mist that clung to the cobblestones. Seamus Byrne trudged past Nelson’s Pillar, the clang of trams echoing through the gloaming. His father’s house on Baggot Street loomed—a gaunt relic among the newer brick, its windows glazed with the rheumy sheen of age. He carried a bag of oranges, their scent sharp as sin, and a prescription from Mercer’s Hospital. The old man’s lungs, they said, were clogged with the soot of sixty years’ pipe smoke and the unspoken things that fester in silence.

*He’ll not thank you,* Seamus thought. *Not him.* The door creaked a lament. Inside, the hallway breathed out cold—linseed oil and mildew, the crucifix above the stair askew as though Christ had twisted to look away. Upstairs, the rasp of his father’s breathing threaded through the dark. 

In the parlor, the gas lamp hissed. Seamus paused by the sideboard, fingers brushing the dusty hurling trophy from ’95. A memory flickered: his father, shoulders broad as a barn door, hoisting him onto the bar at Kehoe’s, the tang of porter and the man’s booming laugh. *“There’s a fierce spark in you, boy!”* But the spark had guttered early—a botched scholarship exam, a clerkship at the docks, his father’s eyes retreating behind the *Irish Times* like shutters. 

The bedroom door groaned. The old man lay propped on pillows, his face a map of eroded cliffs. A tumbler of whiskey trembled on the nightstand, amber catching the lamplight. 

“You’ve come,” the father said, voice a frayed rope. 

“Aye.” Seamus set the oranges down. “Doctor says you’re to eat these. For the vitality.” 

A snort. “Vitality. That ship’s sailed, boyo.” 

Silence pooled. Outside, rain needled the glass. Seamus studied the mantel—yellowed playbills from the Abbey Theatre, a photograph of his mother, her smile blurred by time. *She’d have known what to say.* 

“They’re staging *The Playboy* again,” the old man muttered. “Saw it in the paper. You ever go?” 

“No.” 

“Hmph. Your mother loved Synge. Said he had the ear.” A cough racked him, wet and deep. “I took her, once. You were in her belly, kicking like a Connemara pony.” 

Seamus gripped the bedpost. The past surged—a tide of unspoken words. 

“Da…” 

But the old man’s eyes had closed, his breath settling into the rhythm of the rain. Seamus sank into the armchair, its springs sighing. On the wall, the shadow of the crucifix stretched long, its arms encompassing the room. 

He woke to predawn grey. His father’s hand dangled off the bed, knuckles swollen, the wedding band loose. Seamus reached—stopped. The first tram bell clanged. Light seeped in, revealing the man’s face: vulnerable as a child’s, the stern lines softened. Here was the boy who’d once chased lambs through Glendalough, the youth who’d recited Yeats to a Galway girl, the husband who’d whispered prayers into a coffin’s silence. All the lives he’d buried under silence and smoke. 

The epiphany came not as a thunderclap, but a slow unraveling—a thread pulled from the tapestry of resentment. *We are each other’s ghosts,* Seamus thought. *Haunted by what we might have been.* 

He lifted the blanket over his father’s shoulders. Downstairs, he filled a bowl with oranges, their brightness defiant in the gloom. The prescription lay forgotten. Outside, Dublin stirred—a milk cart’s clatter, a nun’s brisk heels. Seamus stood on the step, the city’s breath mingling with his own. Somewhere, a street organ wheezed a tune his mother had hummed. 

He would return tomorrow.

**Note:** This story channels Joyce’s introspective depth, weaving paralysis and epiphany through layered memories and restrained emotion. The prose echoes his lyrical density, with Dublin itself as a character, while the father-son dynamic reflects Joyce’s fascination with fractured legacy and quiet redemption.
