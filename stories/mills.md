The morning her shadow began unspooling from her feet, Clara found it coiled beneath the kitchen table like a serpent made of smoke. It didn’t mirror her anymore—not the tremble in her hands as she poured coffee, not the way she pressed a palm to her ribs, as if holding herself together. It just _watched_.

“You’re not him,” she whispered, but the shadow rippled, ink-dark edges softening into a silhouette too broad, too familiar. She’d buried that shape six months ago, shoveled dirt over its echo. Yet here it was, pooling in the cracks of the linoleum.

When the jar of Sam’s laughter shattered, Eli found the sound pooled on the floorboards like liquid amber, thick and slow. It had been their best summer, that laughter—ripe with fireflies and porch wine—now seeping into the cracks, fermenting. By noon, the toaster giggled. The doorknob hiccuped. Eli tried to sweep it up, but the broom just hummed _Danny Boy_.

They’d harvested sounds for years: Sam’s snores stoppered in mason jars, their first argument pickled in brine, the wet sigh of a hospital ventilator. Eli’s shelves groaned with the weight of every _what if_ and _never again_. But Sam’s laughter was different. Uncontainable.
