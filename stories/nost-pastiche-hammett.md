**The Glass Shard in the Bloodstain**  

The alley smelled of wet brick and rotting citrus. A single bulb buzzed above the service door of The Silver Slipper, its jaundiced light pooling on the corpse. He lay face-up, a stocky man in a sharkskin suit gone dark with blood. His mouth hung open, a black O of surprise. The rain had started again, thin and needling, rinsing the knife wound in his chest to a raw pink.  

I crouched, gloved fingers brushing the lapel. No wallet. No rings. Just a monogrammed cigarette case peeking from the inner pocket—*E.J.C.* Emmett J. Carroway. City Council, District 7. The reform candidate. The papers had his photo next to words like *incorruptible* and *crusader*. Funny how often those words bleed out in alleys.  

A shadow cut the light. "You the dick they sent?"  

I stood. The cop was young, his uniform cap tilted like a vaudeville drunk. His eyes flicked to the badge on my overcoat—*Continental Detective Agency*—and he smirked. "Heard you boys play rough."  

"Only when the client pays extra." I lit a cigarette, the match hissing in the drizzle. "Who found him?"  

"Bindle stiff. Ran off before we could ask questions." He nodded toward the mouth of the alley where a drunk muttered to a lamppost. "But the doorman at the Slipper says Carroway was here earlier. Met a dame. Brunette, velvet cloche, legs up to Tuesday."  

I inhaled, letting the smoke curl out slow. "She leave with him?"  

"Nope. Left alone. Ten minutes later, he stumbles out, clutching his chest like a bad actor in a gangster picture. Made it six steps before he folded."  

The cop shifted, suddenly interested in his shoes. "Look, the captain wants this quiet. Election’s next week. Carroway’s people are already screaming ‘conspiracy.’"  

"Sure." I ground the cigarette under my heel. "Conspiracies are bad for business."  

The Silver Slipper’s dressing room reeked of gardenias and sweat. Mabel Revere sat at a vanity smeared with greasepaint, her reflection sharp under the bare bulb. The velvet cloche was gone, her hair a dark tumble. She didn’t turn when I entered, just watched me in the mirror as she unscrewed a flask.  

"Private eyes don’t knock?" Her voice was whiskey-smooth, a contralto paid to purr torch songs.  

"Not when the trail’s still warm." I tossed the cigarette case on the vanity. It skidded past a pot of rouge. "Emmett Carroway. You knew him."  

She took a swallow, throat working. "He knew *me*. Came backstage after my set last week. Said he wanted to discuss ‘municipal decency laws.’" Her laugh was brittle. "Funny how that discussion ended with his hand on my knee."  

"Funny," I agreed. "Then tonight?"  

Her eyes met mine in the glass. "He offered me a job. Said his campaign needed a ‘respectable face.’ I told him to try a mask." She stood, hips swaying as she stepped into a fur coat. "Now if you’ll excuse me, detective, I’ve got a midnight train to catch."  

I blocked the door. "You forgot the part where he followed you out, got a shiv in his ribs."  

She froze. For a heartbeat, I saw it—the flicker in her pupils, the too-quick breath. Then she smiled, slow and lethal. "You think I’d dirty my hands on a two-bit hypocrite? Emmett had enemies. The kind who wear silk suits and vote yes on every backroom deal."  

"Like Harlan Voss?"  

Her smile didn’t waver, but her knuckles whitened on the flask. Voss. The waterfront boss. The man who’d owned the city council until Carroway started snapping at his leash.  

I stepped closer. "Here’s how I see it. Voss couldn’t buy Carroway, so he bought someone prettier. Someone to whisper sweet nothings and slip a blade between the ribs. But you got greedy. Kept the cigarette case as leverage, didn’t you? Insurance in case Voss decided to cut *you* loose."  

She slapped me. The crack echoed off the cinderblock walls. Then she was laughing, low and venomous. "You’re good. But you missed one thing."  

"Yeah?"  

Her knee came up fast. I twisted, catching her thigh against my hip. She clawed at my eyes. I grabbed her wrist, felt the bracelet bite into her skin. That’s when I saw it—the faint smudge on her palm. Ink.  

I shoved her back. "You’re left-handed."  

She paled.  

"Pathologist said the knife went in at a upward angle. Right-handed killer." I nodded at the vanity. "But you’ve been signing autographs all night. Smudged the fresh ink on your left palm. Which means you’re a southpaw. Which means you didn’t stick Carroway."  

She sank onto the vanity stool, the fight draining out of her. "Then why—"  

"Because Voss’s real patsy is halfway to Mexico by now. You’re just the decoy." I tipped my hat. "Enjoy your train ride, Miss Revere."  

The street was slick with rain. I walked toward the call box, mind working. Voss would be at his penthouse, sipping brandy and waiting for the headlines. The dame had been a distraction, a scented handkerchief waved under the Agency’s nose.  

I lit another cigarette. Let the cops chase shadows. My job was to deliver facts, not justice.  

But as I passed the alley, something glinted in the bloodstain—a sliver of glass. I picked it up. A lens. Thick, curved. From a pair of spectacles.  

Funny. Carroway didn’t wear glasses.  

The drunk by the lamppost coughed. I looked at him—really looked. The tattered overcoat. The unshaven jaw. And the eyes, sharp behind cracked pince-nez.  

"Evening, councilman," I said.  

He straightened, the drunk act sloughing off like old skin. "You’re smarter than you look."  

"Thanks. I bathe regularly." I held up the lens. "Next time you play dead, lose the bifocals."  

Carroway smiled. "Voss threatened my family. Said he’d burn my house down unless I dropped out. So I let him think he won." He nodded toward the body. "That’s a John Doe from the morgue. Cost me five grand."  

"Neat trick. But the dame?"  

"An actress. Voss approached her, but she came to me. We set him up." He peeled off a glove, offering a handshake. "You could walk away. Let the papers mourn a martyr. Let me disappear."  

I stared at his hand. The rain fell harder. Somewhere, a siren wailed.  

"Five grand buys a lot of silence," he added.  

I took his hand. His palm was dry, cool.  

"One condition," I said.  

"Name it."  

"Give the dame a cut. She earned it."  

He laughed. Then he was gone, swallowed by the storm.  

I dropped the lens in the gutter. Another case closed, another secret buried. The city didn’t need heroes. It needed men who understood that truth, like whiskey, was best served watered down.  

I walked. The night stretched ahead, endless and indifferent. Somewhere, a headline screamed. Somewhere, a widow wept.  

And somewhere, Harlan Voss poured a drink, unaware the noose was already tightening.  

But that’s a story for another day.
