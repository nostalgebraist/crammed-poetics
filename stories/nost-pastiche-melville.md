**Title: The Albatross of Unseen Depths**  

In the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty-something—though precise reckonings founder like a splintered hull upon the shoals of memory—there sailed from the fog-choked port of New Bedford a vessel christened *The Cynosure*, a brigantine of ill-starred timbers and creaking ambition. Her master, one Captain Asa Cobb, was a man whose countenance bore the seared furrows of a life spent scowling at horizons, his soul lashed to some private tempest. Cobb, it was whispered in the dim taverns where sailors congregate to curse God and mumble of wages, had thrice circumnavigated the globe, yet returned each time emptier than a gutted tunny, his eyes twin coals burning backward into the caverns of his skull.  

We were a motley crew: harpooners with forearms like hawser ropes, boys fleeing debts or daughters, and myself—a greenhand signing on as ship’s scribe, a post granted out of pity by a purser who mistook my quill-callused fingers for a mark of seaworthiness. Our mission, Cobb declared in a voice that could flense the meat from a man’s resolve, was to chart the uncharted, to plumb the “voids where God left His drafts unfinished.” A poet’s lie, we soon learned. For Cobb sought neither trade nor discovery, but a beast.  

It began in the doldrums off Tierra del Fuego, when the sea grew sullen as a parson’s wife and the air thickened with the stench of rust. A shape moved beneath us—not whale nor squid nor any creature known to naturalists or drunkards. It shadowed the ship for days, a leviathan tinctured with strangeness, its back barnacled with what the cook swore were *faces*, pressed like medals into the flesh. Cobb, upon spying it, let loose a cry that might’ve been torn from the throat of Saul upon the Damascus road. He ordered the harpoons readied, though the thing dove deep whenever we drew near, leaving only a wake of iridescent froth that glowed at night like drowned phosphorus.  

“Mark me,” muttered the harpooneer Queequeg (for Melville’s shadow looms, and I’ll not shy from homages), “that beast be no child of Earth. It’s Cobb’s own sin made flesh, or the Devil’s draft horse.” The crew, superstitious as jackdaws, took to carving charms from whalebone and muttering psalms backward. Only Cobb stood resolute, his obsession a lodestone pulling us toward ruin. He ceased to sleep, pacing the quarterdeck with a sextant in one hand and a dog-eared Bible in the other, shouting at the stars as if they’d slighted him.  

Weeks passed. The beast grew bolder. It breached once at midnight, shearing off the starboard davits with a tail that shimmered like oil on water. In the moonlight, we saw it clearly: a thing of scales and whispers, its eyes lidless and cold as comet ice. Cobb, in that moment, achieved a kind of rapture. “There!” he roared. “There is the architect of all obscurity! Strike it, and we strike at the very curtain of the unknown!”  

Madness, of course, followed. Men vanished—a boatsman here, a rigger there—snatched by tendrils that slid from the waves like sentient fog. The ship herself began to rot, her planks oozing a black sap that stank of myrrh and decay. Queequeg, in a fit of clarity, declared we’d sailed beyond the maps into a realm where “the sea forgets itself.” Cobb, now more specter than man, laughed at this. “Aye,” he croaked, “and here we’ll learn what the forgetting tastes like.”  

The end, when it came, was merciful in its brevity. A storm rose—a hurly-burly of lightning and groaning winds—and the beast surged upward, enmeshing *The Cynosure* in a net of its own rigging. Cobb, in his final act, leapt onto the creature’s back, a harpoon gripped in both hands, and drove it deep into the gelatinous flesh. They sank together, captain and chimera, into the abyss.  

We survivors, nine in all, drifted seventeen days in a jolly boat, sustained by rain and the grim charity of gulls. I alone kept a log, scribbling with a waterlogged pencil on the margins of Cobb’s Bible. Of the beast, no trace remained. Yet sometimes, in the fathomless quiet of the night, I fancy I hear Cobb’s voice in the surf, locked in eternal colloquy with his monstrous familiar. And I wonder, as all men must, whether he found in those lightless depths the answers he sought—or if, like the rest of us, he merely learned to stop asking.  

Thus concludes the account of Jeremiah Halsey, sometime scribe of the damned.
