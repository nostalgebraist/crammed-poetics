**The Bulls of August**  

The café was empty save for the old man swabbing the tiles with a mop that smelled of vinegar. It was too hot. The sun hung low over the sea, white and mean, and the boy at the bar wiped his neck with a rag, leaving gray streaks. She sat across from him, her fingers tracing the rim of her glass. The anis left a milky film where she’d stirred it.  

“They’re running them tomorrow,” she said. Her Spanish was still careful, like a guest.  

He looked at the sea. The water was flat, the way it got before a storm.  

“You don’t have to go,” she said.  

He turned the glass in his hand. The ice had melted.  

“I know.”  

She leaned forward. Her hair fell in a dark sweep, and for a moment, he thought of the way she’d looked that first winter in Paris, the snow catching in her lashes.  

“You could watch from the balcony. Like before.”  

“I’ll go down.”  

She said nothing. The old man wrung his mop into a bucket.  

“They’re not the same bulls,” she said finally.  

He smiled, but it was thin. “No.”  

They had taken the train down from Bayonne in the dry summer, the fields cracked and ochre. She had worn a blue dress, and her skin smelled of salt. The bulls then were lean and black, their horns slick with resin. He’d stood at the barricade, close enough to feel the heat of their breath, the dust rising in clouds. The crowd had roared when the first one fell.  

Now, the scars on his leg itched. The doctor in Pamplona had said it was the weather.  

“You’ll write if you go?” she asked.  

“There’s nothing to write.”  

She stood, her chair scraping. The boy behind the bar glanced up.  

“I’ll walk,” she said.  

He watched her cross the plaza, her shadow long and narrow. The old man began stacking chairs.  

At dawn, the streets were already thick with men in white shirts, their red scarves knotted tight. He drank coffee at a stall, bitter and thick, and listened to the bells. The bulls would come up from the docks, their hooves clattering on the cobbles. He remembered the sound—like bones in a sack.  

She was on the balcony when he passed, her face in shadow. He raised a hand. She did not wave back.  

The run was short. A young bull broke left, catching a boy against the wall. He lay very still. They carried him past, his shirt blooming red.  

Later, in the room above the butcher’s shop, he washed his face. The water was lukewarm. She stood in the doorway, her arms folded.  

“Did you see it?”  

“Yes.”  

“Was it good?”  

He dried his hands. The towel was rough.  

“It was enough.”  

She turned toward the window. The sea was dark now, the lights of the fishing boats blinking.  

“You could have died,” she said.  

He said nothing.  

“You still might.”  

He lay on the bed, his leg throbbing. She sat beside him, her hand on his chest.  

“Why?”  

He closed his eyes. The room smelled of blood and salt.  

“It’s what’s left,” he said.  

In the morning, she took the early train. He stood on the platform, the sun sharp on his neck. She did not lean out the window to look back.  

The café was empty again. The boy poured him an anis without asking. Out past the breakers, the fishing boats tilted in the wind. He thought of the bulls, how they lowered their heads before the charge, the way the world narrowed to a point.  

He paid and walked down to the docks. The water was green and cold. He did not take off his shoes.
