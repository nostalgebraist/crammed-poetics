## Main text

**Title: "The Sisyphus Seminar"**

The conference room’s fluorescents hummed a B-flat minor, a frequency known—*footnote 1*—to induce migraines in 34% of adults aged 30–50, which was, Rick calculated, precisely the demographic now arranged in a semicircle of ergonomic chairs that promised posture correction but delivered only the faint aura of institutional penitence. The air smelled of citrus-scented industrial cleaner and the collective dread of people who’d paid $1,199 to be told their lives were a series of self-imposed brain-loops, which, Rick conceded, they probably were. At the front of the room, a man named Trevor—*footnote 2*—clad in a hemp-blend suit, paced with the fervor of a TED Talk prophet. His teeth gleamed like a challenge.

“You’re here,” Trevor intoned, pausing for effect, “because you’re *tired* of being *plugged in*. Because you *crave* the *authentic*.” The audience nodded, a synchronized bobblehead ballet. Rick’s phone buzzed in his pocket. He imagined it as a live wire, a third rail. He’d turned it off. Hadn’t he? *Footnote 3*: Three days prior, Rick’s therapist had suggested, not unkindly, that his “compulsive connectivity” might be a “copulative metaphor” for fear of existential void. Rick had laughed so hard he’d snorted green tea.

Trevor clicked a slide: a black-and-white photo of a monk smiling beatifically beside an iPhone. “The *ancient* solution to *modern* problems,” Trevor said. “*Unplugging* isn’t a retreat—it’s a *revolution*.” Rick’s pen hovered over his notebook. He wrote, *Revolution as marketed by a man with a $200 haircut*. The woman beside him, clutching a *Positive Vibes Only* thermos, glanced at his page. Rick angled the notebook away.

*Footnote 4*: The seminar’s brochure had arrived in Rick’s inbox at 2:37 a.m., minutes after he’d googled “how to stop googling how to stop.” The subject line: *Are You Ready to Exit the Maze?* The maze, Rick knew, was a series of nested tabs: work email, Twitter, porn, repeat. The maze was also, he suspected, his own skull.

“Let’s *practice* presence!” Trevor exhorted. The lights dimmed. A guided meditation began, Trevor’s voice oozing through the speakers like synthetic honey. Rick closed his eyes. Saw the flicker of Excel spreadsheets. His ex-wife’s face. A meme involving a capybara. *Footnotes 5–7*: Respectively, deadlines, alimony, and the persistent question of whether capybaras’ calm was evolutionary or just really good PR.

Afterward, during the “organic snack break” (chia bars that tasted like salted sawdust), Rick hovered near the almond milk cooler. The Positive Vibes woman approached. “First time?” she asked. Her name tag read *Janelle*. “I did Trevor’s Ayahuasca retreat in Sedona. Life-changing. Until it wasn’t.” She laughed, a sound like wind chimes in a hurricane. Rick envied her ease. “Why’re *you* here?” she pressed.

*Footnote 8*: The truth involved a 3 a.m. panic attack, a Wikipedia deep-dive on Søren Kierkegaard, and a promotional code. Instead, Rick said, “Seemed cheaper than a divorce.” Janelle’s smile faltered. A beat. Then, kindly: “Nothing’s cheaper than denial.”

Back in the semicircle, Trevor preached “digital asceticism.” Rick’s phone buzzed again. He slipped it out: a notification from his meditation app (*“Breathe in… Breathe out…”*). The irony tasted metallic. He imagined hurling the phone at Trevor’s beatific slide. Imagined the screen cracking into a spiderweb of liberation. Instead, he thumbed *Delete Account*.

*Footnote 9*: He’d re-download it by Uber ride home.

The seminar ended with a “commitment ceremony.” They chanted affirmations. Rick mouthed the words, *I am enough*, which felt both true and intolerably trite. Trevor handed out certificates: *Certified Unplugged*. Janelle hugged him. Her hair smelled like lavender and cigarette smoke. “See you next year,” she whispered. Rick wondered if she meant the Advanced Seminar or the inevitable relapse.

On the train home, Rick’s phone buzzed—a calendar alert: *Seminar Day 1: CONGRATULATIONS!!!* He stared out the window. The city flickered, a circuit board of false promises. He thought of Trevor’s monk, smiling beside a device that outlived him. Thought of Janelle’s laugh. Thought, *This is the maze. The maze is all.*

*Final Footnote*: The next morning, Rick would find the certificate in his briefcase, creased beneath a half-empty bottle of Xanax. He’d smooth it out, tape it to his cubicle wall. It would hang there, a totem, until the adhesive failed, and it fluttered, unnoticed, into the recycling bin. But that’s another story.
